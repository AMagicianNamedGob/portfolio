  "I’m a self-taught full-stack web developer with a background in e-commerce and building tools that improve team efficiency. I focus on clean, practical solutions that work out of the box, and I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, readable, and usable code.";

const aboutMe =
  "“When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on the move—running, holding a yoga pose, or exploring a new trail. I love capturing photos of the small, strange, and beautiful things I come across outdoors. At home, I have a soft spot for life’s little ‘treasures’—whether it’s the next package at my doorstep, collecting a few dumpster fires for laughs, or firing up the PlayStation. These hobbies keep me curious, lighthearted, and grounded—qualities I bring back into my work and the communities I’m part of.”";

const alkalineDescription =
  "Alkaline is my most recent project, and one I’m especially proud of. After months of work, I’ve built a sleek, Astro-powered theme designed for speed, clarity, all using minimal JavaScript. It comes with 14 built-in color themes, multiple layouts, 24 pre-built components, and baked-in SEO optimizations—all while keeping dependencies light. Built with a performance-first, semantic HTML approach, Alkaline consistently scores 100 in Lighthouse audits right out of the box. In fact, this very website was built with Alkaline.";
